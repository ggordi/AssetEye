# Asset Eye

Asset Eye is a web application that enables investors to explore different assets and manage a personalized watchlist. 


## About 

Staying updated on top stock news and asset statistics has been a priority for me ever since I started investing. However, jumping across and around different websites to retrieve key information eventually became very time consuming- that's why I created Asset Eye. With Asset Eye, investors can get the news and statistics all in one place. Next steps for Asset Eye include developing internal fundamental and technical analysis tools, as well as adjusting modules for deployment.
